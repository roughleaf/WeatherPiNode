# WeatherPiNode
Sensor Node using PIC18F26Q10

This project is depricated.

The hardware was updated with various improvements.
One of which is replacing the 2.4Ghz NRF24L01+ module with a 433Mhz AI-Thinker LoRa module to improve communication range and reliability.

I'm investigating if changing to the MQTT protocol will be an improvement on my current implimentation.

A link to the now firmware will be placed here when available.
